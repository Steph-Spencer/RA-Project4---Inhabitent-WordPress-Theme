This is Project 4 for the RED Academy Web Developer Professional Program.

The project is a custom WordPress theme for the fictional Inhabitent Camping Supply Co.
The theme incorporates custom post types, taxonomies, custom meta fields, and uses template parts to streamline the code.



This project is incomplete.
The Adventures section on the home page has not been laid out.
The styling of the footer needs debugging
The overall structure of the site is incomplete and I need to refactor the routing of the templates according to the revised assignment.
The styling of areas beyond the home page is incomplete
The products need their relevant meta field information added to the posts.
